# CodeClauseInternship_SelfDrivingCar
Overview
Welcome to the Self-Driving Car AI Project! This project aims to develop an autonomous driving system using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques. The goal is to create a model that can navigate a car through various scenarios and environments without human intervention.

## Project Structure
1. Dataset:
The dataset directory contains the datasets used for training and testing the self-driving car AI model. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to use and distribute the data.
2. Code:
The code directory contains all the source code for the self-driving car AI project.
Key files:
train.py: Use this script to train the AI model on the provided dataset.
inference.py: After training, use this script to test the model and visualize its performance.
3. Models:
The models directory will store the trained AI models. After training, the model files will be saved here.
4. Documentation:
The docs directory contains project documentation, including this README file.
